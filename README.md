Getting started
---------------

Before anything else, you need to go and [grab the ColdFusion 10 installer file from wwww.cfmlrepo.com](http://www.cfmlrepo.com/):

Once you have that you can get started:

- Fork and clone this repository
- Initalise the submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Copy the ColdFusion 1_ installer file into `./chef/cookbooks/coldfusion10/files/default/`
- (with Vagrant installed of course) execute `vagrant up`
- Wait for the install to finish
- Visit http://192.168.32.10/ in your browser and you should see a ColdFusion dump of the `server` scope

Customisation
-------------

If you'd like to start customising your installation, here are a few easy steps you can take:

- open `chef/roles/cf10.rb`
- customise values in the `override_attributes` section
- MySQL has been setup with remote access for root, so you can use your favourite GUI to gain access to the database
